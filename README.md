# A Life Worth Living

## Purpose

This repository exists as a place for writing. I have started a daily writing practice. I want to, ultimately, land on having written both a nonfiction book and a novel. This is an attempt at doing the former.

The identity and direction of the book is something I'm feeling out as I go.

## Thoughts and Progress

The document where I'm capturing what I'm thinking about as I'm writing and where I'm writing when I don't know what else to write is the [notes on what I'm writing](/notes.md). It is there that you can see my thinking and direction as this project starts to take form.
