## A Life Worth Living

It's hard to know what one should seek in life. To many, success is measured in wealth, status, position, and other such markers. To others, rewards come from family and other relationships. Others want to make an impact on future generations via work that leaves a legacy.

It's not common to stop and think about how one might decide among these differing views of success and what constitutes a life worth living. Generally, it seems most folks go to work for much of the day on most days and recover overnight to do it again. They find some time for recreation, and find themselves happy if their lucky.

The words of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, in outlining self-evident truths, articulate the "pursuit of happiness" as one of the inalienable rights. This is a deviation from the Lockean formulation of "life, liberty, and property."

This inclusion raises questions. Is happiness worth pursuing? Is it an end one shoudl strive to attain? What is happiness, anyway?

## Pursuit of Happiness?

Without thinking about it, it seems that pursuing happiness makes sense. Everyone prefers happiness to unhappiness.

How do you puruse happiness, though?

It seems a nonsensical question. Happiness is not an autonomous creature to follow or a destination to seek. It's not on a map and it doesn't move in ways that can be tracked.

Pursuing happiness seems a matter of seeking it. It doesn't really seem something that can be sought, though. It doesn't seem something you can look for.

Happiness, generally appears in the lives of humans when they have focus on something else. It appears in the form of a child or in the realization of applying means to reach ends. It materializes from relationships, from joyous occasions, from accomplishment. It can sometimes show up without a clear reason.

Usually, it makes an appearance around something of significance in life.

Happiness is often a byproduct of meaning.
