# Introduction

## A Life Worth Living

It's hard to know what one should seek in life. To many, success is measured in wealth, status, position, and other such markers. To others, rewards come from family and other relationships. Others want to make an impact on future generations via work that leaves a legacy.

It's not common to stop and think about how one might decide among these differing views of success and what constitutes a life worth living. Generally, it seems most folks go to work for much of the day on most days and recover overnight to do it again. They find some time for recreation, and find themselves happy if they're lucky.

The words of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, in outlining self-evident truths, articulate the "pursuit of happiness" as one of the inalienable rights. It's interesting to think about the fact that landing on the formulation most Americans can recite without thinking was not clearly where it was headed.

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

The "pursuit of happiness" deviation from the Lockean formulation of "life, liberty, and property" is interesting. Why was property excluded and why was this pursuit the replacement? Jefferson also originally wrote not that the truths articulated were "self-evident", but "sacred & undeniable."

"Self-evident" and "undeniable" don't seem remarkably different. It's not obvious why "sacred" was excluded, though from a modern secular-state viewpoint, it's probably welcome to many that such a nod to faith is not there.

Replacing property with pursuit, though? This departure raises questions. Is happiness worth pursuing? Is it an end one should strive to attain? Is it a better and/or more self-evident truth than property? What is happiness, anyway?

Ultimately, living a human life is something that doesn't come with a user's manual desribing what one should do to make the most of it. We're each left to our own devices to try to decide what constitutes living well.

There are many who would say that society and culture lock us into expectations. They might say that wealth and status indicate success in our societies. Maybe they offer instructions on how to acheive these things or maybe they assert that these expectations should be rejected. I've even heard it said that one should not necessarily seek success. This view holds that success is defined in money and status terms and that these are not worth seeking. It overlooks that success is subjective term and we are all free to define for ourselves what it means to be successful.

The simple fact of the matter is that others may have expectations of you. These others may be parents and other family, employers and managers, or this faceless thing some call "society". Maybe they have expectations and those expectations may or may not be in your best interestes. Regardless, you are not bound by those expectations.

You are the one and the only one who can decide how you should live. This is both liberating and terrifying.

What then, will you use as your guide to living a life worth the name?

## Pursuit of Happiness?

Without thinking about it, it seems that pursuing happiness makes sense. Everyone prefers happiness to unhappiness, at least ostensibly. It's hard to imagine someone explicitly saying they'd prefer to be unhappy.

So happiness is desirable. That makes it something worth pursuing. It's likely for this reason Jefferson landed on the formulation he did.

How do you puruse happiness, though?

It seems a nonsensical question. Happiness is not an autonomous creature to follow or a destination to seek. It's not on a map and it doesn't move in ways that can be tracked.

Pursuing happiness seems a matter of seeking it. It doesn't really seem something that can be sought, though. It doesn't seem something you can look for.

## The Nature of Happiness

The term happiness can be defined as a positive emotional state, often triggered by desirable life experiences. This form is fleeting and temporary.

It can also be defined as a more lating form of overall positive general well-being. This form is more of a nature of how one lives. It could be thought of as a default emotional state when there's not a remarkable life event driving emotion in a given direction. It's more of a lasting type of happiness.

Thinking of a fleeting form of positive emotion makes for a relatively straightforward exercise in trying to think about how one would seek it. Having positive experiences would tend toward yeilding positive emotional states, and it's as simple as that. Liberty to seek positive experiences does indeed seem to be somethign to which all people are entitled, as long as such seeking is not done via coersion or aggression toward other people.

Thinking about a longer-term form of satisfaction is not as straightforward in terms of how one would seek it. It could be as simple as thinking of it as a ledger where experiences add to a sum of fleeting moments of emotion and one is generally happy if there are more positive than negative entries in the column. Maybe there's soemthing to this, but it's certainly not that simple and this view takes a lot of control away from an individual. Everyone has a degree of control over what happens in life, but it's only control to an extent. Many things happen outside one's control and considering happiness as both something of importance and a ledger of good and bad experiences makes it into a game of chance, a roll of the dice.

If it is truly the nature of happiness that it's a leder, then we are indeed at the mercy of fate if it's happiness that we seek. If we want to take control of living a life worth living, therefore, we must either reject happiness as that we seek or view it as something other than just an aggregate sum of experiences.

Or both. It could be that happiness is not really a worthy pursuit afterall, but that happiness appears as a byproduct of something else.

Viewed this way, one can seek this something else, and in doing so, tip the balance of happiness favorably.

## What is Your Quest?

Happiness, generally appears in the lives of humans when they have focus on something else. Happy people are generally not those explicitly looking for happiness, but those experiencing life.

It appears in the form of a child or in the realization of applying means to reach ends. It materializes from relationships, from joyous occasions, from accomplishment. Happiness comes from life's joyfiul moments, big and small. It can sometimes show up without a clear reason.

Usually, it makes an appearance around something of significance in life. That which is significant in any given life is as elusive to put a definition on as is happiness itself. In short significance is in the eye of the beholder.

Significance appears in the early steps of an infant and other remarkable firsts. It can result from code that solves a problem to make software that works. It shows up in helping a stranger with a problem in a way you didn't have to.

Significant moments of varying size can add up to connection with other people and ultimately to a meaningful existence. It's in this meaning that we may find happiness. Generally, that's there. If not, we can at least find rich rewards and it's from these rewards that life can become worthwhile.

Happiness is often a byproduct of meaning.

## What Does it Mean to Find Meaning?

To resolve that something has been concluded by saying that seeking meaning is what yields the rich rewards that lead to a life worth living would fall quite short of delivering something useful. We need to go further than that.

Living with meaning is still far from something obvious. It's not close to an actionable plan. "Go forth and seek meaning" is an admonition that would leave many scratching their heads.

Where then, do we start?

## We Hold These Truths to be Self-Evident

Scottish philopher David Hume articulated the principle known as "Hume's law", "Hume's Guilliotine", or the is-ought problem. Essentially, the idea is that one cannot conclude what ought to be from knowledge of what is.

Philosophers and other logicians are skilled at starting from premises and following them to conclusions. If the conclusion follows from the premises, the logic of the argument is valid. Even if the premises are false, the argument still follows valid logic if the conclusion follows from the premises.

Valid logic, though, is cold comfort when one arrives at incorrect or undesirable conclusions because of false premises.

It's for this reason that one must start from a bedrock of excellent premises and follow valid logic to land on conclusions yielding the results one desires.

Because one cannot draw conclusions about what ought to be from learning about what is true, further input is required to land on a worldview that informs on how one should behave to make the most of existence.

The foundation on which a worldview can be built is constructed from values and axioms.

An axiom is a something one accepts as being true, often something self-evidently true. An axiomatic truth is one that does not require demonstation, it is simply accepted to be true.

## Aims of this book

Given the need for an axiomatic foundation on which to build a worldview, the body of this work intends begin with a set of assertions I take to be self-evidently true. These will form a base of values and principles. These are primarily statements about preferring one way of being to another and claims of what constitutes something being good or bad.

From there, those affirmations of the good will be combined with demonstrable truths about life, the universe, and everything to form a logical progression to a way of seeing the world.

You'll be able to see my thinking on where I start, how I proceed, and how and where I land on the views I have about how one might best conduct their own behavior to maximize the experience of life.

You'll then be able to reject it entirely, view the world completely as I do, or perhpas take away something (maybe even many somethings) you can use in the construction of your own take on how life is best lived.
