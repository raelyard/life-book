# The Truth Will Set You Free

## Does Truth Matter?

It's fine and good to understand that there is absolute truth. It's better still to recognize the limits of human understanding and approach knowledge with epistemic humility.

What do you do with that, though?

Does truth even matter at all? It may be possible that willful ignorance is better than pursuit of truth. If one is ignorant anyway, given the impossibility of complete understanding, perhaps it's best to stay ignorant of even those truths that are attainable, particularly the uncomfortable ones.

There are two clear approaches to determining is truth is really preferable to to falsehood. One is a utilitarian approach and the other is to consider the alternative.

## Alternative to Valuing Truth

To respond to the question of the utility of truth, one need only look at the alternative.

To live in falsehood seems an endless path to ruin. There are popular songs expressing a desire not to know the truth about an unfaithful lover. A song like that is as sad as anything I can imagine - an expression of a person so unwilling to know the truth as to choose to live in the darkness of not knowing something of the utmost importance; something with the power to devastate.

```
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
```

-- Song written by Mario Winans

It's heart-breaking. It's sould-crushing. One cannot listen to that song without feeling overwhelmed with a spirit of hopeless woe. Willful ignorance can't be the way to maximize human flourishing and optimize for an existence worthy being called a life.

If that song doesn't tear out your internal organs, try this one:

```
Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
```

-- Song written by Gwen Stefani and Eric Stefani

It can be hard to face the truth. The truth has the power to destroy. It's understandable to hesitate to face the truth of that which is unpleasant. Realizing the hard truth that reality may not be what we thought it was is disorienting and can be devastating. It's natural to move away from something so terrifying.

What it destroys, though, are the parts of us we don't want. It tears us down to create a stronger and better form with what remains. Believing falsehoods yields a house of cards, destined to collapse. Believing in truth offers the possibility of a light at the end of the tunnel.

The childrens' book, *There's No Such Thing as a Dragon* by Jack Kent is perhaps the best known articulation of the supremacy of embracing truth in one's life. In the book, a dragon ignored becomes a bigger dragon such that a problem of an uncomfortable truth becomes a bigger problem by being ignored. The longer a problem is ignored, the larger it becomes.

However difficult it may be to embrace truth, embracing falsehood is almost universally worse.

## Utility of Truth

If you are trying to use means to attain an end, you are best served to understand exactly what end it is you are seeking as well as the consequences of the means you employ. Understanding is a key element in making optimal use of means and acheiving ends. The answer to the question of whether truth or falsehood serves to enhance understanding is self-evident. Clearly, it's better to seek truth in order to gain understanding and it's better to have understanding to have positive impact in your actions.

Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, truth is clearly favorable to falsehood. A person who seeks and finds truth will be in a better position to act than one who favors falsehood.

Seeking understanding yields better outcomes. Seeking truth yields better understanding. For a human who wants to use means to attain ends, truth is preferable to falsehood. There is no other conclusion for maximizes the life utilty of humanity and the smooth execution of interpersonal interaction.

## Life More Abundant

Living in the light of day, then is preferable to living in darkness. Living a life of truth is a life that yields more life.

> “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.” Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them. Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

-- John 10:1-10 (NIV)

A life of abundance can mean a life filled with material gain. That's probably the first thing one thinks of when hearing the term. And that's right - abundance can and does refer to acquiring possessions. Abundance can mean having more than one could ever use. Really, it just means having more than enough. It doesn't have to be more by a wide margin. It also doesn't necessarily refer to material wealth. It certainly can, but there are many types of rewards one can acquire and acheive. Some of them involve material gain, others don't.

Abundant life is something that can have unique meaning to each and every person.

When the Gospel promises life and having it more abundantly, the meaning of abundance is open to the interpretation of the individual. You can and should seek that which enhances your life and eschew that which drains it.

Given that truth leads to understanding and that understanding is superior to any gained by falsehood and understanding yields superior results in using means to attain ends, abundant life is best served by living in and for truth and seeking truth.

The Gospel goes even further regarding truth, when John has Jesus offering liberation throught truth.

> "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)

It fits the intuition of most people that a life of liberty is one of more abundance than one lacking in freedom. It could be taken as axiomatic that freedom is better than any alternative.

It's via freedom that one is able to choose what to read and otherwise consume and via freedom that huamns can act by choosing their prefered means to attampt to acheive their preferred ends.

Freedom is desiarable and better than any alternative. Truth leads to, or at least points toward, liberty.

This is important.

## The Ways Truth Makes for Freedom

It's interesting that "the truth shall set you free" has a Biblical origin, but it's also a motto on the seal of many secular institutions, including those focused on education and government. It's not really a violation of separation of church and state, but rather a testament to the universal appeal of the foundational truth contained in what appears to be a simple statement.

It's not necessarily obvious, though, that the truth is the path to freedom. It's intuitive, but not obvious that consuming truth is liberating. What about telling the truth, though?

Consider, for a moment, the proposition that telling lies leads to freedom. It's not hard to think of scenarios in which a lie to lead to material gain. Perhaps this means dishonesty is a path to liberation from the need to work for gain fulfill the needs of life.

There's an extent to which lying does have the potential to yield gain. It always comes with a cost, though. 

> "Lying makes a problem part of the future; truth makes a problem part of the past." - Rick Pitino

Legendary basketball coach, Rick Pitino, astutely pointed out the burden that comes with falsehood. Telling the truth does not require maintenacne. Having said what is true stands on its own. One does not have to remember the truth told so as not to constridict it when telling future truths. Truth does not contradict truth.

Lying always runs the risk of future discovery. Gains from defrauding others are gains that must be guarded. Perhaps this is why the dragons of legend must be so powerful and vigilant in protecting their plunder from those who would take it. Ill-gotten gains are never as secure as those attained honestly.

Lies come with the burden of maintining the lie. This burden can be viewed as a form of slavery. Even if that's going too far (I don't think it is), it's certainly something in a direction away from liberty.

## Truthfulness in Human Interactions

```
In order to find your way through all of that,

you need to develop a relationship with something that's profound and you can have that capacity. And what could be more profound than the truth.

And what would you rather have on your side?

and to do more than your best, because your best isn't enough because your best isn't as good as you could be.

You have to push yourself past that.

And that's, as far as I can tell, where you find what you need in life, you find the meaning that sustains you in life. And you find the patterns of action that redeem the world.

Neitzsche said that you could tell much about a man's character by how much truth he could tolerate, which is very interesting.

You know, there's an idea, and in the great western tradition that the truth is the way and the path of life and that no one comes to the father except throught the truth. And I believe that to be the case becauase I don't think you can manifest who you are without the truth.

And so I think it's literally and metaphorically true that the pathway to who you could be if you were completely who you were is through the truth.

And so the truth does set you free but the problem is that it destroys everything that isn't worthy in you as it sets you free.

And that's a process of burning and it's painful because you cling to what you shouldn't be, partly out of pride and partly out of ignorance and partly out of laziness.

And so then you encounter something true and you all know this, you all know this perfectly well.

becauase when was the last time you learned something important that wasn't blow of some sort? You know, it's often you look back at your life and you think "Oh God, I really learned something there. I wouldn't want to do that again, but it really changed my life."

I mean, sometimes it can really destroy you, you know, an encounter with the truth and you never really recover.

But now and then something comes along and straightens you out and a lot of you has to go.

A lot of you has to burn away.

You know? And I suppose, in some sense, the idea is that everything about you that isn't worthy is to be put into the flames.

And that's another reason to be not so casual about what you claim to believe because it isn't something that you undertake without due caution.

You know, I learned when I was a kid, about 25 or so, a little older than a kid, that almost everything I said was one form of lie or another. I wasn't any worse, I would say, than the people I was associating with, or any better. And the lies were manifold, you know, they were attempts to win arguments for the sake of winning the argument. That might be one, (also) attempts to indicate my intellectual prowess when there were competitions of that sort, maybe just the sheer pleasure of engaging in an intellectual argument - my inability to distinguish between ideas that I had read and incorporated, but becauase I had read but hadn't yet realized I hadn't earned the right to use all of that.

And, you know, I had this experience that lasted a long time - I would say it has never really gone away that I was thinking it was the awakening of my conscience, essentialy, this voice, for lack of a better word, made itself manifest inside me. And it said every time I said something that wasn't true. And that's usually what it said: "That's not true. You don't believe that, or there was associated with it, and I don't think this is uncommon. You know, I asked my psychology classes for many years in a row if they had an experience, this experience that they had a voice in their head, let's say, it's a metaphor; or a feeling that communicated to them when they were about to do something wrong. And it was universally the case that people agreed with one of those statements or another.

And the other thing I would ask is "Do you always listen to it?" And of course the answer to that was definitely "No."

Well, you know, I learned that so much of what I was doing was false.

And I think I learned this; see, there was a reason that this came to me so clearly. I was trying to understand why people did terrible things and I was really concentrating on the terrible, terrible things that people do. And I was interested in Auschwitz, for example. And not in, not as a political phenomenon, but as a psychological phenomenon, I was curious about how you could be an Auschwitz guard. And I wasn't really curious about how you could be one becauase, well, you could be that, of course. I was more curious about how I could be one, being such a good person as I thought I was.

And, but I also knew that people, many people did many terrible things during the 20th century and the idea that I was somehow better than them or that I should assume a priori that I was better than them and that I wouldn't have made the same choices or worse had I been in the same situation.

It was a very, very, very dangerous supposition. And that we really needed to understand why it happened and that perhaps we could go deep enough in that understanding, which is what I think happens when you go deep in understanding; so that we could stop it.

Because if you understand the problem, maybe you can solve it. You know?

And, at least in part, I came to believe that the problem was, as Solzhenitsyn said, that the problem is that the line between good and evil runs down every human heart.

And I was reading Jung at the same time and, you know, he believed that the human soul was a tree whose roots grew all the way to hell and believed also that in the full investigation of the shadow, which was the dark side of the human psyche, was that it was bottomless, essentially. That it was like an experience of hell.

And that also struck me as true.

And that the way to stop those sorts of things from happening was to stop yourself from being the sort of person who would do it, who would even start to do it.

Because the other thing when you learn when you learn about attrocities of that sort, for me it was a matter of understanding that the way to stop such things, too, from happening, the way to remember properly is to understand that you could do it. That you could do those terrible things because the people who did them were like you.

And that the way out of that is to stop being like that.

And the way you stop being like that is by ceasing to tell yourself lies that you don't believe in, and that, you know you shouldn't act out.

And, you know, that's made a huge difference in my life, for better, for worse. I mean, it was a very uncanny experience, I would say, becauase it's very discombobulating to experience yourself as fragmented enough so that much of what you do and say is actually false.

It's a lot of work to clean that up. A lot, but the consequences are, in principle, worthwhile.

And so that was part of what drove me toward clinical psychology, say, and away from political science and law and from politics in general becausae I started to believe that, and I think this is the great Western idea that the proper route forward for the redemption of the individual and for making as a whole is as a consequence of the redemption of each individual. And I truly believe that.

And I believe that happens as a consequence of adherence to the truth and courage in the face of being.

That's rule 1, right? To stand up straight with you shoulders back is to take on the onslaught and to enter the contentious ring and to do your ..., to do more than you best, becauase your best isn't enough. Because your best isn't as good as you could be. You have to push yourslef past that.
