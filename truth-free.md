# The Truth Will Set You Free

## Does Truth Matter?

It's fine and good to understand that there is absolute truth. It's better still to recognize the limits of human understanding and approach knowledge with epistemic humility.

Does truth matter, though? It may be possible that willful ignorance is better than pursuit of truth. If one is ignorant anyway, given the impossibility of complete understanding, perhaps it's best to stay ignorant of even those truths that are attainable, particularly the uncomfortable ones.

> "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)
