# The Truth Will Set You Free

## Does Truth Matter?

It's fine and good to understand that there is absolute truth. It's better still to recognize the limits of human understanding and approach knowledge with epistemic humility.

What do you do with that, though?

Does truth even matter at all? It may be possible that willful ignorance is better than pursuit of truth. If one is ignorant anyway, given the impossibility of complete understanding, perhaps it's best to stay ignorant of even those truths that are attainable, particularly the uncomfortable ones.

To respond to the question of the utility of truth, one need only look at the alternative.

To live in falsehood seems an endless path to ruin. There are popular songs expressing a desire not to know the truth about an unfaithful lover. A song like that is as sad as anything I can imagine - an expression of a person so unwilling to know the truth as to choose to live in the darkness of not knowing something of the utmost importance; something with the power to devastate.

```
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
```

-- Song written by Mario Winans

It's heart-breaking. It's sould-crushing. One cannot listen to that song without feeling overwhelmed with a spirit of hopeless woe. Willful ignorance can't be the way to maximize human flourishing and optimize for an existence worthy being called a life.

It can be hard to face the truth. The truth has the power to destroy. What it destroys, though, are the parts of us we don't want. It tears us down to create a stronger and better form with what remains. Believing falsehoods yields a house of cards, destined to collapse. Believing in truth offers the possibility of a light at the end of the tunnel.

It's in facing the truth where meaning is to be found.

## Life More Abundant

Living in the light of day, then is preferable to living in darkness. Living a life of truth is a life that yields more life.

> “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.” Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them. Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

-- John 10:1-10 (NIV)

> "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)

## Truthfulness in Human Interactions

"Lying makes a problem part of the future; truth makes a problem part of the past." - Rick Pitino

In order to find your way through all of that,

you need to develop a relationship with something that's profound and you can have that capacity. And what could be more profound than the truth.

And what would you rather have on your side?

and to do more than your best, because your best isn't enough because your best isn't as good as you could be.

You have to push yourself past that.

And that's, as far as I can tell, where you find what you need in life, you find the meaning that sustains you in life. And you find the patterns of action that redeem the world.

Neitzsche said that you could tell much about a man's character by how much truth he could tolerate, which is very interesting.

You know, there's an idea, and in the great western tradition that the truth is the way and the path of life and that no one comes to the father except throught the truth. And I believe that to be the case becauase I don't think you can manifest who you are without the truth.

And so I think it's literally and metaphorically true that the pathway to who you could be if you were completely who you were is through the truth.

And so the truth does set you free but the problem is that it destroys everything that isn't worthy in you as it sets you free.

And that's a process of burning and it's painful because you cling to what you shouldn't be, partly out of pride and partly out of ignorance and partly out of laziness.

And so then you encounter something true and you all know this, you all know this perfectly well.

becauase when was the last time you learned something important that wasn't blow of some sort? You know, it's often you look back at your life and you think "Oh God, I really learned something there. I wouldn't want to do that again, but it really changed my life."

I mean, sometimes it can really destroy you, you know, an encounter with the truth and you never really recover.

But now and then something comes along and straightens you out and a lot of you has to go.

A lot of you has to burn away.

You know? And I suppose, in some sense, the idea is that everything about you that isn't worthy is to be put into the flames.

And that's another reason to be not so casual about what you claim to believe because it isn't something that you undertake without due caution.

You know, I learned when I was a kid, about 25 or so, a little older than a kid, that almost everything I said was one form of lie or another. I wasn't any worse, I would say, than the people I was associating with, or any better. And the lies were manifold, you know, they were attempts to win arguments for the sake of winning the argument. That might be one, (also) attempts to indicate my intellectual prowess when there were competitions of that sort, maybe just the sheer pleasure of engaging in an intellectual argument - my inability to distinguish between ideas that I had read and incorporated, but becauase I had read but hadn't yet realized I hadn't earned the right to use all of that.

And, you know, I had this experience that lasted a long time - I would say it has never really gone away that I was thinking it was the awakening of my conscience, essentialy, this voice, for lack of a better word, made itself manifest inside me.
