# Overall Thoughts on this book and what it will be

## Purpose

In this work, I want to drive toward outlining a way of arriving at a way of viewing the world with an eye on what the reader can take away to live a prosperous and fulfilling life.

I want to outline the way I view the world and what matters and what does not.

This is not an appeal to get readers to think what I think, but an effort at sharing my thought process in the hopes that readers can examine their own ways of thinking and move toward a place of having worldviews that are consious and deliberately chosen. I also want to make my thinking explict so I'll understand it better and, hopefully, I'll get some resistance from readers will shed some light on places my thinking needs updating or changing.

I am living a life with many blessings and I'm glad for it. I think I've realized some truths that make for a pretty decent way of approaching life. I think I have something to share, not only about how to live, but about how to land on a view on how to live.

I want to land on what truths I hold to be axiomatic and work from those truths toward a way of approaching life, business, news, and philosophy that yields `rich reward`.

## Rich Reward

A life worth living is not just one with material wealth, though it likely does include that.

What are the outcomes that constitute a life worth living?

That might be a title candidate - `A Life Worth Living`.

The answers to the above question are something to work toward in the chapters of the book.

That's my direction.

## Book Approach

The thought in my mind that has led to here is that what I should write is a broad philosophical work that starts with my axioms and builds from those as foundational, combining the `oughts` I hold to be axiomatic (and self-evident).

It's pretentious to say I'm a philosopher. I am in a sense, but I'm nothing fo the sort. I could not tell you the first thing about Plato, Aristotle, or Socrates. I don't know the different between Nietzche and DeCartes. I have no schooling and haven't really done any reading.

Maybe I need to describe and define what it is that I'm setting out to do. Maybe it is called philosophy or maybe I need another word. Maybe I need to call it something less pretentious.

I suppose it's really `self-help`. That sounds so cheap and demeaning. Maybe it applies.

I'm uncertain exactly what it is I'm writing.

Nonetheless, I'm writing.

I have started with writing an [introduction](/introduction.md) about what I think constitiutes `rich reward` and `a life worth living`. It gives a start on what I'm trying to do and why we need to start with truths held to be axiomaic.

You have to start somewhere. I have done that.

Perhaps what is emerging now is a work with sections. The first section may be in regard to what are axioms both either self-evidently true or at least justifiable and worthwhile for inclusion in the foundation of a worldview. Then another section on conclusions that follow from those axiomitic truthes. Then one that brings those conclusions together into (what does it bring them together into? - maybe a coherent worldview? maybe something better/different than that) a coherent worldview.

I have added some notes here on candidates for what are my `truths I hold to be self-evident`. This is the beginning of thinking about what might become the chapters of that first section. Still something i'm thinking about. Still a work in progress.

## Plural of Axiom

It seems that either axioms or axiomata are acceptable. Axiomata sounds pretentious and probably better to use axioms. Need to decide for certain.

## The Truth as I Perceive it

I almost called this section "my truth", but that sounds exactly like what folks say these days who think all truth is relative and can be whatever someone decides. I do not think that.

Despite that I do not hold such a belief, there is an element of goodness in it. There's an extent to which I do buy into it.

I hold that the truth is the truth and there is no form of truth that is "my truth" or "your truth", but I acknowledge that truth can look different when viewed from a different perspective. This is like the story of the blind men and the elephant (a reference to that belongs in the book).

Thus, my heading here of `the truth as I perceive it`. I am a seeker of truth. I have a bit of a glimpse into what it is in some respects, but it would be the height of hubris to say I really konw anything.

Any claim I make about truth can only be made confidently to the extent that it's disclaimed with knowing that my ignorance is vastly greater than my knowledge. I do not claim to be wise in the ways of the wisdom of Socrates, but I do recognize the glorious humility in stating that `the only thing I know is that I know nothing`.

With this admission in mind, knowing that what I can claim to know is a fraction of a sliver of a grain of sand and knowing that what I think I know is colored by my perspective, I will start to attempt to articulate what I beliieve to be the fundamental truths that form the foundation of how I live my life.

- Truth is preferable to falsehood.
- Truth is usually a path to freedom.
- Human knowledge is always incomplete.
- Property is a fundamental good.
- Aggressing against peaceful people is wrong.
- Aggressing against the property of peaceful people is wrong.
- Other people care as much about their families and concerns as I do about mine.

## Draft Outline

Maybe this thing starts to fall out into something like this:

Section I: We Hold These Truths to be Self-Evident
Section II: It Follows That...
Section III: Finding Freedom in an Unfree World (with due respect and citation to Harry Browne)

With a little flesh on what might go within (chapters with some notes within some):

1. We Hold These Truths to be Self-Evident
    1. [What is Truth?](/what-is-truth.md)
        - John 18:38
    1. The Truth Will Set You Free
        - John 8:32
    1. Perception of Truth
    1. Limits of Understanding
    1. Axiomatic Foundations
    1. (Perhaps a chapter for each of the foundations, justifying inclusion)
1. It Follows That...
    1. ???
1. : Finding Freedom in an Unfree World (with due respect and citation to Harry Browne)
    1. ???

Starting on writing (a) chapter(s). Linking in the outline when they exist.
