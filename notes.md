# Overall Thoughts on this book and what it will be

## Purpose

In this work, I want to drive toward outlining a way of arriving at a way of viewing the world with an eye on what the reader can take away to live a prosperous and fulfilling life.

I want to outline the way I view the world and what matters and what does not.

I want to land on what truths I hold to be axiomatic and work from those truths toward a way of approaching life, business, news, and philosophy that yields `rich reward`.

## Rich Reward

A life worth living is not just one with material wealth, though it likely does include that.

What are the outcomes that constitute a life worth living?

That might be a title candidate - `A Life Worth Living`.

The answers to the above question are something to work toward in the chapters of the book.

That's my direction.

## Book Approach

The thought in my mind that has led to here is that what I should write is a broad philosophical work that starts with my axioms and builds from those as foundational, combining the `oughts` I hold to be axiomatic (and self-evident)

It's pretentious to say I'm a philosopher. I am in a sense, but I'm nothing fo the sort. I could not tell you the first thing about Plato, Aristotle, or Socrates. I don't know the different between Nietzche and DeCartes. I have no schooling and haven't really done any reading.

Maybe I need to describe and define what it is that I'm setting out to do. Maybe it is called philosophy or maybe I need another word. Maybe I need to call it something less pretentious.

I suppose it's really `self-help`. That sounds so cheap and demeaning. Maybe it applies.

I'm uncertain exactly what it is I'm writing.

Nonetheless, I'm writing.

I think I'll start with writing an introduction about what I think constitiutes `rich reward` and `a life worth living`. With a little flesh on that, I might have an idea of where I'm going from there.

You have to start somewhere.
