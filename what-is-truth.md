# What is Truth?

In the Gospel narrative, when John has Jesus before Pilate, an interesting interchange occurs.

> Jesus said, 'My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.'
    You are a king, then!' said Pilate.
    Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.'
    What is truth?' retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, 'I find no basis for a charge against him.

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)

It's hard to know what to make of this account and the actors in it, but it seems to be a Jesus interested the fundamental nature of what is true, and a Pilate interested in other matters and dismissive of the seeking of higher truths. It's a story illustrative of the world in which we live.

We spend a great deal of time dealing with the mundane matters of life and not as much thinking about ultimate truths and not the nature of truth itself.

Pilate's retort seems perhaps a dismissal of truth as something worthy of consideration, but it's also phrased as a profound question one would be wise to consider.

There are some who argue that there is no absolute truth. They hold that there are only perceptions and that frame of reference colors everything that is such that nothing can be absolutely true from every perspective.

There's an element of truth to this position, but it misses the mark.

Stating `there is no such thing as absolute truth` is a self-defeating argument. It's a claim that holds that it's aboulately true that there's nothing absolutely true. Self-contradition makes the argument logically invalid.
