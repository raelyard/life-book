# What is Truth?

## An Interesting Question

In the Gospel narrative, when John has Jesus before Pilate, an interesting interchange occurs.

> Jesus said, 'My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.'
    You are a king, then!' said Pilate.
    Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.'
    What is truth?' retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, 'I find no basis for a charge against him.'

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)

It's hard to know what to make of this account and the actors in it, but it seems to be a Jesus interested the fundamental nature of what is true, and a Pilate interested in other matters and dismissive of the seeking of higher truths. It's a story illustrative of the world in which we live.

We spend a great deal of time dealing with the mundane matters of life and not as much thinking about ultimate truths and not the nature of truth itself.

Pilate's retort seems perhaps a dismissal of truth as something worthy of consideration, but it's also phrased as a profound question one would be wise to consider.

Indeed, it's useful to wonder "what is truth?" It's worth considering the nature of the truth.

## Only an Evildoer Deals in Absoltes

There are some who argue that there is no absolute truth. They hold that there are only perceptions and that frame of reference colors everything that is such that nothing can be absolutely true from every perspective.

There's an element of truth to this position, but it misses the mark.

Stating `there is no such thing as absolute truth` is a self-defeating argument. It's a claim that holds that it's aboulately true that there's nothing absolutely true. The statement is a truth claim that states that truth claims are all wrong, thus the self-contractiion. Self-contradition makes the argument logically invalid and untenable.

If stating that there's no such thing as absolute truth is an argument in favor of there being at least that statement that is absolutely true, it can simply not be argued that there's not such thing as absolute truth. Therefore, something must be absolutely true.

In *Revenge of the Sith*, George Lucas gave film consumers a grand duel between the powerful friends-turned-enemies Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader. Before the physical altercation began, the verbal exchange between the two led to where it inevitably had to lead - hostility. In the course of the confrontation, Vader declares that "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy" and Kenobi responds with "Only a Sith deals in absolutes" (the Sith being the society serving as the primary antagonist of the saga and a murderous lot with power lust which Vader has recently joined at this point in the story).

Taken only at face value and literally, this statement by Kenobi is clearly an absolute statement, which, if true, would mean that Kenobi himself is a Sith. Clearly, it's not the case that only a member of the order of the Sith deals in absolutes.

His statement, made in a stressful moment of conflict with emotions running high, was really more about that there are more ways of looking at the situation than a binary choice of being with one another or enemies. So, "only a Sith deals in absolutes" is both a silly contradiction on the surface and also a profound truth underneath that cuts to the core of the nature of truth. It's stated in the same way and with the same mistake made by the truth relativists, but it's revelatory of the same underlying truth at which they grasp.

Truth exists and is real, but human understanding of truth is limited and perspectives shape how we understand and view the truth. Truth is absolute, but our percpetion of it is not.

## The Truth is an Elephant

There is a story that is credited to Eastern traditions. Wikipedia cites there being ealy versions in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts. It is a story that highlights the nature of underlying truth and the limits of human perception of it.

> A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, "is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.

The story of the *Blind men and an elephant* illustrates deeply the relationship between human perception and truth. There is truth and we have an ability to perceive it, but our perceptions have limitations. What you are able to ascertain is not the whole truth. It's a little comical that the standard oath for witnesses in courts often entails telling "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth." It's hubris to think that any human can know the whole truth in all but the most trivial of matters. It would probably be better, more sensible, and more humble to take an oath to tell the "truth as I perceive it, all of the relevant information I beelive to be true, and nothing but that which I believe to be true."

## The Importance of Humility Regarding Truth

Those who try to argue against absolute truth are doomed because of the inherent self-contradiction in what they propose, but there's a reason the argument has appeal and holds sway. That reason is that's it's hard to know the truth. In fact, it's impossible about a great many things. Trying to gain a better understanding the way the natural universe works is a worthy pursuit, but human understanding is always incomplete. Complete understanding of anything nontrivial is generally unatailable. Therefore, what one thinks to be true is often only a reflection or a shadow of the real truth. This makes truth appear to be something other than absolute. This is the reason why people disagree vehemently about matters that seem to be factual in nature.

There are truths that are absolute. It's just hard to know what they are and when we think we know, we often find out our understanding is not as great as we thought.

Consider the amusing pastime of quoting movies. If you've ever engaged in stating quotes from films you've seen numerous times, you'll have had the experience of certainty that you remember exactly what was said by a character in a film, only to find that your memory has deviated from reality. It's a phenomenon highlighting the peculiar nature of human memory.

It also shows that what you think you know is not exactly right. If you can be wrong about unimportant details in small things, is not also possible you can be wrong about bigger and more important matters? It's not necessarily the case that the we're wrong about important information, but it's a possibility woth considering.

## What Does One Really Konw?

There's a story about that the Oracle of Delphi declares Socrates the wisest man in Athens, which took Socrates by surprise. Socrates declared ignorance and claimed that he knew nothing. This began an exploration of the nature of wisdom. He ultimately came to accept the declaration of the Oracle by concluding that nobody knows anything and he is wisest for recognizing this fact. His knowing his own ignorance is what makes him wise.

It's this humility, known as `The Wisdom of Socrates`, that is where any humble human who has thought at length must land.

Of all the things there are that could be known about way the natural universe works, only a fraction of a fraction is known to humanity and any one person knows only a fraction of a fraction of that. There's more that could be known than one could even begin to approach in many multiples of lifetimes.

Even when considering people known to be experts in their fields, the knowledge they have is a minute portion of what could be known. Further, no knowledge can ever really be certain. The accepted experts also often have a great deal of training leading them down a path of thinking in the way things have always been done in a given field. This is useful, but can also close the door to considering other ways of perceiving the turth.

Listening to experts is advised for good reasons and it's good to take expert opinions as having great weight. It's also critical to consider that their authority has limits and one should always apply reasoning to everything.

The scientific method is considered to be the gold standard for a way of determining what is true. Science is broadly considered to be the most certain of the ways of knowing. There are good reasons to think so.

And yet science is an exercise in creating understandings that are always subject to further upgrades from later thought, observation, hypotheses, discovery, experimentation. Science yields understandings of natural phenomena that are the best understandings we have.

And they are always far from perfect and far from complete.

Science is never finished. Statements saying "the science is settled" reveal a significant misunderstanding of what science is. The truly scientific mind will acknowlege the limits of what science has to offer. The truly philosophical mind will ackownledge the limits of what huamns do and can understand.

Acknowledging one's own ignorance and incompleteness is called epistemic humility, and it is perhaps the most important virtue one can possess.
