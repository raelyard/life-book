# What is Truth?

## An Interesting Question

In the Gospel narrative, when John has Jesus before Pilate, an interesting interchange occurs.

> Jesus said, 'My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.'
    You are a king, then!' said Pilate.
    Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.'
    What is truth?' retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, 'I find no basis for a charge against him.

-- John 18:36-38 (NIV)

It's hard to know what to make of this account and the actors in it, but it seems to be a Jesus interested the fundamental nature of what is true, and a Pilate interested in other matters and dismissive of the seeking of higher truths. It's a story illustrative of the world in which we live.

We spend a great deal of time dealing with the mundane matters of life and not as much thinking about ultimate truths and not the nature of truth itself.

Pilate's retort seems perhaps a dismissal of truth as something worthy of consideration, but it's also phrased as a profound question one would be wise to consider.

## Only an Evildoer Deals in Absoltes

There are some who argue that there is no absolute truth. They hold that there are only perceptions and that frame of reference colors everything that is such that nothing can be absolutely true from every perspective.

There's an element of truth to this position, but it misses the mark.

Stating `there is no such thing as absolute truth` is a self-defeating argument. It's a claim that holds that it's aboulately true that there's nothing absolutely true. Self-contradition makes the argument logically invalid.

If stating that there's no such thing as absolute truth is an argument in favor of there being at least that statement that is absolutely true, it can simply not be argued that there's not such thing as absolute truth. Therefore, something must be absolutely true.

In *Revenge of the Sith*, George Lucas gave film consumers a grand duel between the powerful friends-turned-enemies Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader. Before the physical altercatino began, the verbal exchange between the tow led to where it inevitably had to lead. In these hostile words, Vader declares that "If you're not with me, then you're my enemy" and Kenobi responds with "Only a Sith deals in absolutes" (the Sith being the society serving as the primary antagonist of the saga and a murderous lot with power lust which Vader has recently joined at this point in the story).

## The Importance of Humility Regarding Truth

Those who try to argue against absolute truth are doomed because of the inherent self-contradiction in what they propose, but there's a reason the argument has appeal and holds sway. That reason is that's it's hard to know the truth. In fact, it's impossible about a great many things. Trying to gain a better understanding the way the natural universe works is a worthy pursuit, but human understanding is always incomplete. Complete understanding of anything nontrivial is generally unatailable. Therefore, what one thinks to be true is often only a reflection or a shadow of the real truth. This makes truth appear to be something other than absolute.

Generally, though, there are truths that are absolute. It's just hard to know what they are and when we think we know, we often find out our understanding is not as great as we thought.
